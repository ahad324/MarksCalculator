                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obtained Marks: 19 <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max Marks: 40 <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weightage: 10 <br />
                  So, write the data accordingly in the fields and click the
                  submit button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once you have entered the name, you can add assessment marks
                  for that subject without rewriting it and press the submit
                  button.
                </li>
                <li>Your Marks are also being updated in the Result Card.</li>
                <li>
                  If you want to update the marks for a subject, then you can
                  copy that name from the Result Card and paste it in the
                  Subject name field. Then you can add more assessment marks for
                  that subject.
                </li>
                <li>Grades are Given According to University Criteria.</li>
                <li>You can also print the Result.</li>

                <p>Your Grade Point Average (GPA) is a numerical representation of your overall academic performance, calculated by averaging the grades you receive in each course. Similarly, your Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) reflects your performance in a specific semester, while your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) provides a cumulative view of your academic journey.</p>
